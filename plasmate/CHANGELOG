  any open editor's contents. Timeline works beautifully now! \o/

--February 6, 2010--

  (now, we have to connect it to the editor, to refresh the view)

  implementation of a Project Management Dialog, that currently only

  to documentation widget.

  polishing yet =)

- Added preliminary support for importing plasmoids.
  'Recent project list' now shows project folder names instead of 
  plasmoid names to avoid confusion.

  work, but online publishing doesn't for now.

  tree, and existing files can be deleted by doing a right-click > Delete.

--November 13,2009--

--October 27,2009--
- Restored previewer dockwidget (while retaining previewer tab for now).
  Previewer refresh button now asks the mainwindow to save any unsaved

  menubar item with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-F5 for now) that does the same.

--October 26,2009--
- Editor contents are now automagically saved on swapping files/tabs and
  on exit.

--October 18,2009--
- Selecting metadata now brings up the metadata editor GUI - but it doesn't
  really work.

--October 1,2009--

  UGLY and BUGGY.

--September 26,2009--

--September 25, 2009--
- Fixed more editor issues : all tree widget entries are now correctly named
  and properly mapped to their respective files.

--September 23, 2009--
- Fixed clicking certain files in the editor component tree widget causing plasmate
  to crash. Issues remaining for editor:
    - File entries are not properly named in editor's project structure tree.
    - metadata.desktop is not currently editable (or visible).

--September 20, 2009--
- Editor component now makes a (buggy) attempt to load clicked project files
  with an editor kpart. Also fixed a bug causing editor kpart to
  not load the first time the editor component is loaded.

--September 19, 2009--
- Fixed previewer refresh code: Refreshing now properly reflects changes since previous
  refresh. Also fixed issue with refreshed plasmoid being smaller than original.

--September 12, 2009--
- Loading a project now also attempts to load a preview in previewer

--August 29, 2009--
- Modified the newSavePoint() method to prevent a crash when the user want to store his first 
  SavePoint, but then it discard the "new SavePoint" dialog.

--August 22, 2009--

  characters when the user types a new branch name.

--August 10, 2009--
- Fixed StartPage issue: opening/creating a project, when an other one is already open, now
  works.
- TimeLine didn't reload properly when changing from an existing project to an other. Fixed.

--August 9, 2009--
- Moved "New SavePoint" buttom from timeline to workflow dock widget. Changed workflow
  signals connection in order to restore the previous tab after setting a SavePoint.
- Added bool GitRunner::hasNewChangesToCommit(), so New SavePoint dialog is triggered only if
  there are uncommitted changes.
- Moved "On Section: <name>" button on the top of TimeLine dock for usability reason, because
  if there are lots of SavePoints, the user has to scroll down each time he want to perfom an
  action Section-related.
- Fixed plasma-containment-studiopreviewer.desktop file; now it doesn't interacts with 
  "Desktop Settings" -> "Desktop Activity" entries.
- Some fixes and coding style fix.

--August 3, 2009--
- When creating a new project, metadata.desktop file is filled with the required fields
- Added setAuthor and setEmail to GitRunner class, so now TimeLine can set that fields
- Review createNewProject code.
- Fixed some krazy warnings.

--July 30, 2009--

  <username>@none.org. These values are inserted in the header contained int the main script
  file.

--July 29, 2009--
- Fixed saving/reloading layout ( still need some fixing with previewer dimensions btw )
- Now templates are installed under $KDEDIR/share/apps/plasmate/templates
- When creating a new project, PlasMate makes a copy of the corresponding template in the
  working directory, modify its file name and the main class to match the project name. 

--July 26, 2009--
- Added radio button to select the scripting language, connected KLineEdit::returnPressed()
  signal, saved docks position so the next time PlasMate is loaded, it reloads docks previous
  position ( need more fixing btw ).
- Added templated folder, with simple sources for plasmoid and data engines.

--July 25, 2009--
- The loading of a text editor at the Publish tab was unnecessary. Removed.
- Cancel button added to new project screen.

--July 21, 2009--
- Fixed the issue with the KRestrictedLine form; now it accepts correctly all names composed by
  characters a-z,A-Z,0-9, and "_", "."

--July 19, 2009--
- Added merge capabilities to TimeLine class.

--July 17, 2009--
- TimeLine now is able to create/delete branches, move to a selected commit ( creating also a new
  branch to preserve other commits ), restore the current state to whatever commit ( deleting all
  the commits performed after it, in the same branch ), init itself and save commits.

--July 14, 2009--
- Now the TimeLine sets-up a menu for each item, available by right-clicking on it: implemented the
  switch branch feature.

--July 12, 2009--
- Fixed a strange behaviour with GitRunner class which causes the app to continue runnig, even if
  the app is closed. Extended TimeLine class; now it shows in the main window the current branches
  and its related commits, and more infos are provided when moving the mouse over the icons.

--July 7, 2009--
- Fixed DvcsJob behaviour when are performed sequential calls, like in the unit test.
  Added the following action in the GitRunner class: remove, status, log, reset, newBranch,
  switchBranch, branches.

--July 5, 2009--
- Splitted the Sidebar class, coded the following git action: init, add, commit, isValidDirectory
  and clone ( only with local repo, for now ). Wrote a simple test case, and start integrating it
  in the timeline class.

--June 1, 2009--
-Appropriate kpart shown when an item is selected from the tree in the Edit tab.

--June 24, 2009--
-Simple 'Pick wallpaper plugin' functionality added to previewer
